== Purpose

.The PostgreSQL https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html[documentation] of `+CREATE ROLE+` mentions:
[quote]   
----
If the presented password string is already in MD5-encrypted or SCRAM-encrypted format, then it is stored as-is regardless of password_encryption (since the system cannot decrypt the specified encrypted password string, to encrypt it in a different format).
----

Which is not only useful during dump and restore, but also when initializing a new installation.

This is a simple tool to create SCRAM-SHA-256 encrypted passwords.

== Usage

[source,shell]
----
./pgpasswd.sh user pass
----

outputs

```sql
CREATE ROLE "user" WITH
  LOGIN
  PASSWORD 'SCRAM-SHA-256$4096:...';
```

which can be fed directly into PostgreSQL.
